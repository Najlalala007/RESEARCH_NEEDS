As a person with BPD, I understand that my unstable friendships are due to a lack of security. I have come upon some very good friends over the past couple years, and I realized that I don\\u2019t mind seeing them interact with other people(for the most part). Normally, I would go, \\u201cOh great! Symptoms gone, I\\u2019m no longer driving myself up the wall!\\u201d but the problem is, I feel like I\\u2019m going through the motions of friendship without actually feeling it? I\\u2019m not really attached to them. I have been told that I am like family to them. I have been there to support them and they have supported me when times got hard.\\n\\nI appreciate the acts of reciprocation; I\\u2019ll drop almost anything help them and they\\u2019ll do the same, but I don\\u2019t really feel affection towards them. If they never messaged me again, or disappeared without warning, I would be confused, if the topic came up, but it\\u2019d be more like out of sight, out of mind. Like, oh, that\\u2019s inconvenient, guess I\\u2019ll have to find a new lunch buddy.\\n\\nAnd then while that\\u2019s going on, I have an internet person who\\u2019s becoming a little too close to becoming my FP for my comfort(I haven\\u2019t had a proper FP since I was 13), and the thought of them liking other people more than me makes me feel like my insides are on fire. It eats away at me from the inside out, and then I cry, then I tell myself I\\u2019m over it, and generally feel ok for a while while interacting with them and hearing them talk about other people before the cycle starts over again. \\n\\nWhat is this? Some kind of detachment to keep from hurting if they leave? Or am I getting better and the FP thing is a momentary relapse of judgement for one person? How do non BPD people go about their friendships? Do they feel things, or just pretend they do? I feel like that can\\u2019t be it. Not sure if I should go back to therapy to discuss with a professional again. I feel like I\\u2019m some kind of monster forcing myself into human skin and playing a role for the happiness of others and societal pressures. \\n\\nSurely this nothingness towards the very stable friendships in my life isn\\u2019t supposed to be how I feel?\",\n          \"Starting \\u201calternative treatment\\u201d for depression I\\u2019ll be starting Ketamine treatment (legal, considered microdosing) soon for my depression. It\\u2019s been a really tough couple of years and I\\u2019m at my wits end.\\n\\nI\\u2019m hopeful but I\\u2019m also scared of the psychedelic experience that comes along with it. I\\u2019ve been scared of psychedelics my whole life and now I\\u2019m getting nervous.\\n\\nNot really sure why I\\u2019m writing this. I guess I just need to scream it into the ether. So thanks for reading!\\n\\nIf anyone has experience with medical doses such as this, I\\u2019d love to hear it. (Not microdosing street K.)\",\n          \"Tell me your recovery story from your last manic episode :). My last manic episode lasted for around 3 months and I was In hospital for most of it, I was very delusional and I was very destructive. It pushed away a lot of friends, broke some bridges and of course made for some embarrassing flash backs for when stable me returned. \\n\\nAfter I left hospital I had the usual come down of being manic and that lasted for around 5 months which at the time seemed to last for a year. After coming out of the depression I stopped smoking weed as I finally admitted to myself that this was a huge trigger for me. Because I quit weed my mind seemed clearer and less foggy so me and my family grew closer again, in fact something I remember my dad saying to me when we was having a beer on his garden in the sunshine was \\u201cI feel like I have my son back\\u201d \\n\\nFinally feeling a lot better than I have in perhaps a decade and a half plus a year out of hospital I started the look for a girlfriend again. Surprisingly an old girlfriend who I always remained friends with liked the change in me and we started dating. We\\u2019re still together and we still are madly in love.\\n\\nI\\u2019ve just recently gone full time at my job, which is something I\\u2019d never dream of doing because of stress triggers.\\n\\nIn comparison to my friends in terms of milestone in life and material things my accomplishments seem small but to me I feel like I have achieved so much, a healthy mind, a close family and a loving girlfriend.
